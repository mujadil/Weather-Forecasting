# Weather Forecasting using Prophet and Visualizations with Plotly & Seaborn


Project Overview

This project aims to forecast weather conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation, using Facebook Prophetâ€”a robust forecasting tool designed for time series data. The project also includes extensive visualizations using Plotly and Seaborn to present the data trends and forecasted values interactively and aesthetically.
Features

    Time Series Forecasting: Predict weather metrics (e.g., temperature, humidity) using Facebook Prophet.
    Interactive Visualizations: Utilize Plotly to create dynamic and interactive visualizations.
    Statistical Plots: Use Seaborn for detailed statistical analysis and visual representation of the dataset.
    Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset for forecasting.
    Evaluation Metrics: Calculate and visualize model accuracy using metrics such as MAPE, RMSE, etc.

Technologies Used

    Python: Main programming language.
    Prophet: Time series forecasting library.
    Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
    Plotly: Interactive visualizations.
    Seaborn,Matplotlib: Statistical data visualization.
    Colab Notebook: Environment for developing and testing the code.

Installation

    Clone the Repository:

    bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Weather-Forecasting.git
    cd Weather-Forecasting

Install Required Packages:
Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Then, install the dependencies using pip:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Requirements:
The requirements.txt file should include:

text

    pandas
    plotly
    seaborn
    prophet
    jupyter

Usage

    Load the Dataset:
    Make sure your dataset is in a .csv format and placed in the data/ directory.

    Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    Launch the Jupyter Notebook and open weather_forecasting.ipynb.

    bash

    jupyter notebook

    Forecasting and Visualization:
    Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, fit the Prophet model, and generate forecasts. Visualize the results using the provided Plotly and Seaborn plots.

Dataset

The dataset should contain historical weather data with at least the following columns:

    Date: Timestamps for the data points.
    Temperature: Daily temperature records.
    Humidity: Daily humidity levels.
    Precipitation: Daily precipitation records (optional but recommended).

Ensure the dataset is cleaned and formatted correctly for time series forecasting.
Visualizations

    Plotly: Interactive time series plots for actual vs. forecasted values, with hover effects and zoom capabilities.
    Seaborn: Pair plots, heatmaps, and distribution plots to explore the relationships and distributions in the data.

Results

The results section in the notebook will display:

    The forecasted weather metrics for the future period.
    Interactive plots comparing actual and predicted values.
    Model evaluation metrics for assessing the forecasting accuracy.
